        #   loops in the composition (or projections that are explicitly specified as
        #   recurrent). They need an initial value so that their receiving mechanisms
        #   have input.

        #   can be viewd as the starting points of recurrent loops.

        # values are not changed based on the graph analysis. Additional mechanisms may

        # - Input: Input mechanisms accept inputs from the input_dict of the composition.
        #   All Origin mechanisms are added to this category automatically.
        # - Output: Output mechanisms provide their values as outputs of the composition.
        #   All Terminal mechanisms are added to this category automatically.
        # - Target: Target mechanisms receive target values for the composition to be
        #   used by learning and control. They are usually Comparator mechanisms that
        #   compare the target value to the output of another mechanism in the composition.
        # - Monitored: Monitored mechanisms send projections to Target mechanisms.
